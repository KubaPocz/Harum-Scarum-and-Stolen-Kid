# 🎪 Harum Scarum & Stolen Kid

**Harum Scarum & Stolen Kid** is a stylized game in which you play as a determined grandmother on a mission to rescue her kidnapped grandson from a twisted circus crew.  
The game focuses on a simple but strategic gameplay loop: **stat allocation → combat → progression**, repeated until the final boss is defeated.

This project is my **first game developed in Unity**.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

- Play as a grandmother fighting her way through circus-themed enemies  
- Core loop:
  1. Distribute character statistics  
  2. Fight an enemy  
  3. Improve your character and prepare for the next battle  
- Face **4 enemies** in total, each more challenging than the last  
- Defeat the **final boss** to rescue your grandson  

The game emphasizes **decision-making and progression** rather than fast reflexes.
